# README
This project is intended to create a static site for the Demascz food truck. The Demascz food truck is a fake brand being created by Bradley Fargo with the art direction slash brand philosophy of Zach Mega (lmk if I should remove this). The intent of the fake brand is uncertain. At the very least it will help (third person) Bradley (me, the person writing this) get a job. Or something.

Eventually, this site will be hosted at the domain demascz.com (unfortunately, d…ômascz.com didn't register properly when I tried to register it with google domains, it gave me some domain at xn--dmascz-wyc.com, which simply will not do. I got a refund and registered demascz.com instead). I believe with Github Pages the redirection from blasphemetheus.github.io to demascz.com is possible with the inclusion of a CNAME file in this project. I'll figure that out once the static html is in good shape.

# Project Navigation

For now there is an `index.html` file holding all of the html. At some point, an `html` folder will exist which will house the html that does not live in the top level of the project directory.

There will at some point be a `CNAME` file providing redirection to demascz.com.

There is a `css` folder that holds all of the css.

There will be a `javascript` folder that will hold all of the javascript.

There is an `assets` folder that houses all the images and art assets.

# hashtag Goals

The goals of this project are:
- produce a static website that looks professional with real art assets
- feature specific behaviors including:

-- a centered wide version of a logo with a menu acting as a header when the user is scrolled to the top of the page and make that wide logo and menu disappear and be replaced by a top-left anchored logo with the menu appearing somewhere nearby when scrolled down.
-- on hover of some element of the site, a psychedelic corn will appear.
-- a menu of the food truck which will lookk like it changes month to month
-- rousing food photography that fits with the aesthetics of the art assets

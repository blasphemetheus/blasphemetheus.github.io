MUSIC

Music is for those who earn it. If you are part of the dumbass team, if you show up first, you get to deejay.

The music is intended to be something that no one in the room has heard before. Random exploration of worldly genres and cringe music is encouraged. Ultimately, all power to choose is held in the hands of the deejay of the moment. If you're a customer and you get there before any dumbass worker, congratulations, you're the deejay now.

        *eyes begin to glow*

        <h3>Hours and Locations</h3>
        The food truck is open for business on the solstices from 3 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Currently, the St. Louis Metropolitan area is the only area where the food truck can be seen in the wild.
        <h3>Contact</h3>
        The address is 1234 Cherokee St, St. Louis, MO 63118. You may call the number (314) 722-8342 although it will not lead to the food truck.
        Contact Shia Labeauf for the password.
        <h3>Catering</h3>
        The food truck is available only to those who truly need it. Since no one currently needs the food truck, the food truck is unavailable.
        <h3>Press</h3>
        If any members of the press come looking, they are not invited. Journalism is worthy of respect but no press passes are available.
        <h1>Black Lives Matter!</h1>
        Black Americans are routinely discriminated against, bothered, silenced, sucked into the legal system, harassed, ignored and otherwise mistreated. It is the position of the Food Truck that this is a bad state of affairs.
        If you have trouble with the statement Black Lives Matter, go fuck yourself.
